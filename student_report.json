    "industry_analysis_feedback": "The response thoroughly explains why the bargaining power of suppliers is the key challenge for Southwest Airlines, emphasizing their dependence on Boeing. It also compares this to the threat of new entrants, effectively justifying the former's significance.",
    "comparison_score": 27,
    "comparison_feedback": "The response provides an in-depth analysis of Southwest Airlines' reliance on Boeing, addressing the supplier bargaining power effectively. A clear comparison with the threat of new entrants is made, demonstrating why supplier power is deemed more critical, although could slightly expand on the specific effects of this reliance.",
    "rag_score": 23,
    "rag_feedback": "Good use of the case: your points that Southwest began with three Boeing 737s in 1971, operates a single-type 737 fleet, uses point-to-point low-cost operations, benefits from 737 fuel efficiency, and faced imitation attempts by Continental (CALite) and United are supported by the case. However, the claim that Boeing has explicit bargaining leverage over Southwest isn’t stated in the case, your assertion that United and Continental had costs “more than 10 cents per mile” is contradicted by Exhibit 2 (their ASMs are ~7.5–8.3 cents), and the statement that threat of new entrants is low due to capital requirements is not explicitly documented in the case.",

    "presentation_feedback": "The response is well-organized and presents a clear, logical argument with few grammatical issues. Minor adjustments could enhance fluency and precision."
